The tamoc package is a Python scripting suite for simulating the nearfield dynamics of oil and gas spills in seawater.  The tools in this package can be used in a very wide variety of ways.  The purpose of the User Guides published here is to show examples of typical usage in oil spill modeling.

For more information about each of the modules, classes, and functions contained in tamoc, see the :ref:`api`.  To see additional examples of the use of these tools, see the files distributed in the ``./bin`` directory with ``tamoc``, listed also in the :ref:`scripts`.
