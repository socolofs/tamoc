Testing Package

The tamoc package is distributed with an extensive set of test files, which are distributed in the ``test`` subpackage of ``tamoc``.  These were developed over the years that ``tamoc`` was created.  Some of the earlier test packages (e.g., those for the ``ambient`` or ``dbm`` modules) are more crude and less elegant.  In any case, these tests still serve to preserve the functionality and accuracy of ``tamoc`` simulations.

This page provides a quick reference to the unit tests distributed with tamoc.  For the source codes of each test, please see the ``tamoc`` source files in ``./tamoc/test``.
