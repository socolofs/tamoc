"""
Blowout Module:  Blowout Simulation
===================================

This script demonstrates using the `blowout.Blowout` class to simulate a
synthetic subsea accidental oil well blowout.  This class does much of the 
work that would otherwise be done through scripting interfaces to the ``TAMOC`` suite of modules and functions.  

Here, we simulate a synthetic blowout with a dead oil flow rate of 20000
bbl/d and a gas-to-oil ratio of 2000 released through a 0.2 m diameter
orifice at 1000 m depth. We use the `dbm.FluidMixture` object to compute the
oil and gas equilibrium and properties, and we use the `particle_size_models`
to compute the gas bubble and oil droplet size distributions.
