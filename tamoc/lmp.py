    Calculate the derivatives for the system of ODEs for a Lagrangian plume
    
    Calculates the right-hand-side of the system of ODEs for a Lagrangian 
    plume integral model.  The continuous phase model matches very closely 
    the model of Lee and Cheung (1990), with adaptations for the shear 
    entrainment following Jirka (2004).  Multiphase extensions following the
    strategy in Socolofsky et al. (2008) with adaptation to Lagrangian plume
    models by Johansen (2000, 2003) and Yapa and Zheng (1997).

    Make sure the correct temperature is stored in the state space solution
    
    When the dispersed phase particles equilibrate to their surrounding
    temperature, heat transfer is turned off by the methods in 
    `dispersed_phases.Particle`.  This is needed to prevent numerical 
    oscillation as the particle becomes small.  Unfortunately, it is not as
    easy to make the numerical solution compute the correct result once
    particle temperature effectively stops being a state space variable since
    the state space is intrinsic to the ODE solver.  The derivatives function
    computes the correct heat transfer based on the correct state space, but
    the state space in the ODE solver remains fixed.
    
    Since the solution for heat in the state space of the ODE solver is the
    wrong value, we have to change the external version of the state space
    before saving the solution to the current model step.  This follows the
    same method and reasoning as the similar function in 
    `smp.correct_temperature`.
    
    Hence, the purpose of this function is to overwrite the state space 
    solution containing the particle heat that is extrinsic to the ODE solver

    integration has stopped (e.g., after the particles leave the plume) with
    NaN so that the post-processor always knows whether the solution in the

    a different independent variable for their time, tp.  Also, particle
